# How to make a release?

TODO:


0. Repository preparation:
   - check that master tests are green
   - update documentation, at least README.md files for subpackages
     (detailed doc should be mantained continuously before merge to master)
   - update CHANGES.md
   

1. Determine the release version number: major.minor.patch
   - Major for backward incompatible changes, changes in API.
   - Minor for backward compatible changes, substantial API extension, possible slight changes in numerical results.
   - Patch for fixes, minor improvements, no substantial new features.

2. Set the version in the setup.py.

3. Push changes, wait for passed tests.

4. Create new release at github, using the same version code.

5. Wheels are automaticaly created and published to PYPI, see that this action has passed including the test installation. 


Alternative, manual tagging:

git tag -a v1.2.3 -m "v1.2.3"
git push origin v1.2.3

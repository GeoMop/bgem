# How to make a release?

TODO:
- fix tox fr py35, py37
- action for publishing a release on tagged version
  - GITHUB release - manual ?? 
  - PYPI release
  


    On Bacula, copy publish directory x.y.z to x.y.z_release.
    Convert CHANGES.md and README.md to html Jekyll files: make web-content
    Update the web: main.js, features, changes, readme
    Check that all links work.
    Upload to repository (publish)
    Create release tag, eg. for release 1.8.2 (within 1.8.2 branch):

git tag -a release_1.8.2 -m "Release 1.8.2"
git push origin release_1.8.2

0. Repository preparation:
   - check that master tests are green
   - update documentation, at least README.md files for subpackages
     (detailed doc should be mantained continuously before merge to master)
   - update CHANGES.md
   

1. Determine the release version number: major.minor.patch
   - Major for backward incompatible changes, changes in API.
   - Minor for backward compatible changes, no changes in API, possible slight changes in numerical results.
   - Patch for fixes, no substantial new features.

2. Set the version in the setup.py.

3. Wait for passed tests.

4. Create new release at github, using the same version code.

5. Wheels are automaticaly created and published to PYPI, see that this action has passed including the test installation.
